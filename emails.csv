breaking news ! !
april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its
sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and
road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m
well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well
immediately there after .
the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban .
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and
gas has prepared a detailed project description .
project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and
has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil
and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .
the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major
oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely
eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the
deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in
the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more
specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .
through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres
( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %
of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in
5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .
land discussion
our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and
northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480
acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling
spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160
acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units
( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased
well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering
pekisko oil we will down space as well .
geological discussion
pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and
associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the
pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable
shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and
account for billions of barrels of reserves .
production facilities discussion
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed .
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed
drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is
approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,
excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of
red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get
oil product to the transportation system .
for more detailed project description please see news release dated
( fri , apr 29 ) .
good luck and successfu | trading .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch

dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku
for : ( the family ) .

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini , president of atlantis business development
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf
dear shareholder , addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading . up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market . our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on .
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial , accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask ; why the energy
related field ? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this
year alone , most of which is because of china . the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone . there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field . these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own . i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw
by concentrating on a specific
sector such as the energy area we will be able to
define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
way to participate in the booming oil gas and
energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

on june 14 , 2000 , a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation ,
mr . alan baker made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar
months , valued at us $ 8 , 320 , 000 . 00 , with us . upon maturity . i sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , a
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers ,
global oil corporation that mr . baker passed away .
on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will
or a testament , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i also discovered that mr . baker did not declare any kin or
relations in any of his official documents , including his deposit paperwork
in my possession . this has been fixed under our management . no one will ever
come forward to claim it .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the beneficiary to this investment . i am writing to you because i
cannot operate a foreign account . i want to present you as the beneficiary
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney .
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney
prepares the necessary documents , which will put you in place as the
beneficiary to this investment .
please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this
transaction will be of mutual benefit , as you will be entitled to 30 % of the money and the remaining 70 % for my own investment . if you are

this one appears tame , smith said ,
but could be dangerous because wild animals are unpredictable . people should not
approach it , nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a
chase . the best thing to do is ignore it , keep away from it and call the
authorities , he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off , the animal
walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard . the cat is
said to have lunged at the child . as the story goes , the man fended it off with
a chair , his wife grabbed their child , and they ran into the house . the cat sat
on their back deck for a while looking in , just like at the in another tale on a
different street , a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin . the cat sneaked up on them from behind , and she
jumped into the pool with the boy . they swam to the other side , but it followed
them . they all ran into the house , and the cat sat looking in the door .

investor alert newsletter - april issue issue 2005
gbic is set to soar this monday !
in april ' s issue we are going to profile a stock that is very much undervalued
and has just started trading . ground floor opportunity for everybody .
this small treasure is : gbic ( gulf biomedical corp )
the stock is trading at only 20 cents and we expect it will hit 50 - 60 cents in
the second week of april
huge pr campaign expected this week so grab as much as you can up to 45 - 55 cents
range
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that : )
about the company :
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair . they are
mostly men , but also a substantial number of women . most of that 60 - milloin wish
they had it back . gulf biomedical corporation ( gbic ) has a breakthrough product
that will help them . no , it will really help them .
there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing ,
until you read the fine print . the fine print says , "" this doesn ' t work for
everybody . "" it says , "" results may take four months or more to appear . "" it says ,
"" beware of the side effects . "" it says , "" a long term contract is required . ""
gbic has hairmagict . there is no fine print . hairmagict says , plain and simple :
"" hairmagict grows hair . easily . painlessly . inexpensively - for less than $ 2 a
day . results in 4 weeks , or your money back . ""
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
the product :
the product is hairmagictand it grows hair . no , it really grows hair . how
important is that ?
an estimated 60 million american men and women ( yes , women too ) are losing - or
have already lost - their hair . most of them would give anything to have it
back . people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really
don ' t . funny ? sure , if you have a full head of hair . if you don ' t , you would
probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your
head .
that ' s what the experts call a "" market ! ""
now , you ' ve seen all the ads . they are full of hair - growing promises , plus
warnings that their product doesn ' t work for everybody , and beware of the side
effects . one promises the buyer will see results , if any , in four months . all of
them cost a veritable fortune .
now , finally , there ' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair , and
hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less , or give you a 100 %
refund . and , incredibly , hairmagictsells for less than $ 2 a day .

controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq .
miles ) in montana . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and
gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source :
company website ) currently trading at . 012 p
possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has
started and is expected to last all week . pp
imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so
if you had the scoop on the following stock : p
( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .
otc : dmxpp
about the company : p
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all
located over what management considers to be some of the most
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those
found in north america . p
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company
moves forward . p
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p
delta has experienced significant technical success since its
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further
exploration is justified . p
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and
finance additional exploration . p
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an
extensive exploration program . pp
( source : company website ) p
recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p
delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a
conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p
delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in
preparation of work program . p
delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold
exploration findings in south america . p
delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond
exploration in south america . pp
will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is
critical . good luck and happy trading . pp

i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if

traders ' monthly alert
january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 ,
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) !
our next pick is an incredible find that will
outperform all others based on their solid
numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in
financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal
with chinese government - run companies totaling
$ 10 billion !
urgent buy at any price :
global environmental energy corp .
otcbb - geec
current price - 1 . 90
running to - 6 . 00
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge ,
and honeywell .
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible
to assign a value to the size of the market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major
impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and
environmentally safe process converts into clean , green
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,
industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural
gas , and the huge market of used tires .
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is
then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the
disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact
the global waste problem while a major push for generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot
topic due to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with
chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal
mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3
billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china
meet its energy needs .
the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares
should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most
explosive gains on wall street .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

located at :
technische universit?t m?nchen , germany : http : / / www . mpeg - 68 . de / location . php
the open workshop of musicnetwork is at its third edition . the modeling ofmusic
notation / representation is a complex problem . music representation can be used
for several different purposes : entertainment , music education , infotainment ,
music archiving and retrieval , music querying , music production , music profiling ,
etc . in the current internet and multimedia age many other applications are
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more diffuse
of the present applications in short time . end users have discovered the multimedia
experience , and thus , the traditional music models are going to be replaced by
their integration with multimedia , audio visual , cross media . at present , there is
a lack of music notation / representation standard integrated with multimedia . the
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music
notation / representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment ,
that presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of standard
formats for multimedia consumers .
the topics of the workshop are related mainly focused on :
- - music notation / representation requirements
- - music protection and distribution
- - music description and its usage on archive query
please contribute with your work on the above topics , for details see the www site
of the workshop .

mr francis oma
attn : director / ceo ,
a cry for family help .
i am mr francis oma the first son of the late mr . peter oma . my father had served mr b . h . lions who was an irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village . my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death . my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe . he also became a successful businessman , because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing , my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence .
we left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $ 11 . 5 m ( eleven million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) and valuables ( diamonds ) worth us $ 5 m . my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival .
he also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition .
barely two months after we moved to johannesburg , we got information that my father ' s farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed . my father ' s property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans .
i believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms . we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives . our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund . have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer . your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum , 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i . the diamond will be discussed at our arrival .
we do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard . we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us , should this proposal meet your utmost consideration , please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address .
the confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands . please treat this proposal with the utmost regard , and the confidentiality of these business should not be over - emphasised .
please response on this email address ; francisoma @ zwallet . com
waiting for your favourable response .
thanks and god bless ,

dr . nkem george .
bank of the north ,
victoria island branch ,
lagos , nigeria .
my dear friend ,
i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of
the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria .
i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled with
extreme confidentiality .
on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a
numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months
valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred
united states dollars only ) in my branch .
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in
accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply .
after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian
national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james
herbert died from an automobile accident .
on further investigation , we found out that he died
without making a will and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all
his official documents including his bank deposit
paperwork in my bank .
this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of
my bank to a security company in europe for
safekeeping .
no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the
nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the
fund .
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security
company in europe .
i contacted you because it is against our code of
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the
security company in europe .
we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum
would be for you if you agree to take part in this
profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my
colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay
back the expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction by both parties after the
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account .
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction , the following information would be needed
from you to expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to
establish you as the next of kin of our late client
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund .
this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment / fund to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where
you can be reached at all time because this
transaction entails constant communication .
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of
the transaction .
if you are interested , send the requested information
via email
i await your response urgently .
regards ,
dr . nkem george .

bpet ( bnp petroleum corp ) is in position to take advantage of the
current oil crisis . stock in this company is expected to dramatically
increase in value in the next 1 - 2 weeks .
symbol : bpet . pk
current price : $ 0 . o 2
short term target price : $ o . 45
12 month target price : $ 1 . 12
news :
london ( reuters ) - - march 31 , 20 o 5 - - oil markets have entered a
` ` super - spike ' ' period that could see 1970 ' s - style price surges as high as
$ 105 a barrel , investment bank goldman sachs said in a research report .
goldman ' s global investment research note also raised the bank ' s 20 o 5
and 2006 new york mercantile exchange crude price forecasts to $ 5 o and
$ 55 respectively , from $ 41 and $ 4 o .
these forecasts sit at the top of a table of predictions from 25
analysts , consultants and government bodies surveyed by reuters .
` ` we believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we
have referred to as a ` ` super spike ' ' period - - a multi - year trading
band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption
and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy
prices return , ' ' goldman ' s analysts wrote .
c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
bnp petroleum corporation , inc . is an irving based oil and gas
exploration and development ( ed ) company . bnp petroleum corporation , inc . was
formed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas
properties with proven reserves . the company ' s strategy is to focus in
domestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have reduced
their exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the
larger reserves . considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be
exploited by well - managed independent oil companies capable of
extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects .
bnp petroleum ' s initial development strategy has been to acquire such
proven fields and increase production through the application of
advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same
fields .
bnp petroleum corporation ' s primary operational strategy includes the
operation of its own projects , giving it substantial control over
drilling and production costs . the company has associated with highly
experienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that
strive to add production at lower costs through development drilling ,
workovers , behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations .
the company ' s long - term strategy is to build an oil and gas production
company through a strategic combination of selected property
acquisitions and an exploration program . additionally , the company will continue
to rework existing wells in an attempt to increase production and
reserves .

irving , texas , may 25 , 20 o 5 / prnewswire - firstcall / - - bnp petroleum
corporation ( otc pink sheets : bpet - news ; bpet ) , an independent oil and
gas company , announced today restarting of hooks lease located in
wichita county texas , after accomplishing modifications and upgrades on
some wells , in the last few months . the shallow wells previously had been
producing oil and water at low rates due to low bottom pressure , which
is normal for the area . steadily increasing rates of production for
hooks lease are expected .
bnp director , rafael pinedo said today , bnp petroleum will begin
immediately to restart other leases in our portfolio of properties and
complete all necessary work to assure that bnp ' s properties are in full
compliance with the regulations of the texas railroad commission and re -
establish oil production on bnp ' s leases over the coming months .

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

it was spur - m that helped . but i am happy enough to be able

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a | ong - term bull market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oil and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil belt
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
watch this stock friday morning
symbol - eogi
price - . 09
the value of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas providing opportunity
for 22 - we | | re - entry in field with strong producing history and large
recoverable reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and drilled by major
oi | companies
in the 1970 s . the fieid is estabiished with substantial recoverable reserves ,
estimated at over
3 . 9 miliion barrels of oil and about 2 bi | | ion cubic ft . of gas in the two pay
zones .
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bu | |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - millions , eogi is selling for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particulariy close attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably smal | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oi |
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daiiy jump in energy prices .
but all that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equally expiosive
effect on the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline
slightly , you wiil stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wi | | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oi | and
gas reserves are we | | established and are going into massive production .
early investors will secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in this
area will really turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s builetin .

it was very difficult to operate my online business . my inboxes were filled with
advertisements for every product and get rich quick scheme out there . my
email accounts were for business use and all of my customers knew me by them ,

clean but it was getting worse by the month . after spending hundreds of dollars
on spam blockers and countless hours i finally found the perfect solution . it

ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

i ' m not sure if you can help me , but i have a danny conner deal from december 2000 that has a price issue .
we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .
stack manager changes
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected .
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as restricted top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "" restricted top of stack "" feature .
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" all "" option from the drop down box .
website changes
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .
price of limit orders
modify limit orders
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the "" today ' s orders "" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the "" set "" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .
expiration time for limit orders
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet .",0

yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

all ,
ena is building an ena origination track similar to that of the trading track . originators on both the gas & power side at the vp level have bought into the development of this program . the management of the program will be the originators themselves under louise kitchen . there will be structured rotations for the analysts & associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in origination .
the below people , according to our records , are currently in your groups . these candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and / or have performed well in the previous prc . prior to contacting the below analysts & associates , i want to ensure your buy - in / recommendation of these candidates . all selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the origination management team ( both gas & power ) prior to joining the program .
i would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in november to commence interviews .
if you have any questions , please let me know and i will be happy to explain the program in greater detail .
kind regards ,

darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all .",0

lauri , from a legal standpoint , we can cut the nomination on an
interruptible agreement at our discretion . the contract clearly gives us
this right . i haven ' t specifically reviewed the contract , but i am assuming
it is our standard form . i will check this .
yes , i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities . the fact that
this goes to entex first complicates the issue .
dan , was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities , or if

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?
thanks for your help .",0

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",0

gary :
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer .
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated
to hpl strangers gas contract .
volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from
someone , but never received one .
here are the months and volumes that need resolution :

possible solution :
1 . need a deal to cover the periods in question , or
2 . provide authorization to writeoff the volumes . ( print & return original
to clem cernosek )
approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss

3605,ham,"Subject: zero path termination in path manager
matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .

george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward :
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 .
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) .
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward :
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly .
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out .
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm .
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks .

george ,
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow .

subject : 24 x 5 products
eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

3595,ham,"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",0

mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction .
"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country .
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of federal case law .
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if
someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no
problem .
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth ,
and call it ecology .
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment .
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is
violated .
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical .
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and
his commandments .
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression .
for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor ,
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event ,
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law -
yet . ""
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme
court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one
nation under god .
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .
praise god that his remnant remains !
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001
jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my
father . ""
- - - - - - - - -
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it .
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

hey joe ,
here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the
highest index .

based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

can hpl sever the point some other way ?

2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts

clay ,
i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .
thanks , richard

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

daren ,
when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

it is amazing and yet not surprising how much enron has accomplished in the
first six months of this year . you continue to make it happen . we recognize
that you work hard every day to accomplish enron  , s business goals , and we are
pleased that many of you have shared in the company  , s financial success
through enron stock options .
as you may know , the current employee stock option program ( also known as the
all employee stock option program or aesop ) began in 1994 and provided value
to participants through 2000 . employees who have participated in this
program from its inception have realized a 1 , 119 % increase in the value of
their stock options ( assuming a stock price of $ 70 ) over the life of the
program .
enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package
and a contributing factor to your performance and to enron  , s continued
success . therefore , the enron executive committee and the compensation and
management development committee of the enron board of directors have decided
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package .
on may 1 , 2000 , the committee approved an employee stock option program for
calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .
? eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant
of stock options .
why commit your talent and energy to enron ? enronoptions  ) your stock option
program , among other good reasons  ( that  , s why .
in the coming weeks , you will be receiving more details about enronoptions  )
your stock option program . to provide information and answer your questions ,
we will introduce a special link on the human resources web - site , host
several espeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular
basis . in the meantime , if you have immediate questions , please contact your
human resources representative .
note : in addition to final approval by enron  , s board of directors , granting
of options will be subject to new york stock exchange and state and federal
regulatory requirements . it is expected that enronoptions  ) your stock
option program will be available to most enron employees ; however , some enron
companies  , employees may not be eligible due to legal , accounting , tax , labor
or business issues . as you know , enron changes to meet the needs of the
marketplaces we serve . given that need to change , we will continue to refine
the eligibility for enronoptions  ) your stock option program and will
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and
samson lone star , 012 - 77555 - 105 , 96016761 .

reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

2386,ham,"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february .
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !

daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and

in light of december ' s allocation of actual volumes at kcs # 9797 , it looks as
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside ,
# 3543 , where the "" sell "" portion of this buy / sell occurs for the remainder of
january . december actual receipts at # 9797 were 15 , 889 mm or an average of
513 mm / day . the january nomination is 864 mm / day . i think it needs to be
reduced to approx 345 mm / day effective 1 / 11 or there may be a large diffence
between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to kcs at

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

i think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up
for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need
a demand fee entered ( hopefully next week ) . i will email you the spreadsheet
after we have received all of the cash and are ready to pay tenaska iv .

subject : re : koch midstream services co
since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?

i am not familiar with this system but it seems philosophically we should protest even though we don ' t currently do any business on this pipeline .
what do you guys think ?

subject : inquiry ?
tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .
thanks .

subject : bridgeline workorder
i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .
if you have any questions , please let me know .

please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of
your favorites .
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .
attached is the url for user to run the application .
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the
application .
here is the steps they should do :
1 ) launch internet explorer
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and
click on above url )
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names
into the group .
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .
4 ) click on "" comments "" button to add messages : there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "" comments "" button . there are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box :
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or
( 2 ) click on "" send "" button to send the message .
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages .
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .
note : right now the application is under test environment . if they like it , i
will move it into production environment soon .

to all employees :
this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses :
- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner .
- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing .
- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion .
- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline .
these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so .
as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer .
for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .
i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions .
when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities .
on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .

our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest .
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
fuel . we are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu / d knowing that we should start
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .

daren - meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom . this meter is has been
over nominated . it has had a nom of 1 . 000 / day ( 429 . 000 total mmbtus ) since
1 / 28 / 99 and has flowed only 11 . 692 . am i correct to say that this meter
needs a lower nom ? please let me know if i should look out for a lower nom
in may . pat seems to think this may be affecting the p / l for april . we only
have estimates / actuals of zero on 4 / 1 & 4 / 2 .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

? customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions . if a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it .
? if a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price , both orders will be cancelled . the customer would have effectively transacted with himself .
please call me if you have any questions . thanks .

10 , 000 should be allocated to adonis # 51862 on the 5 th only . nothing should
be allocated or confirmed for adonis on the 16 th . additionally , it looks
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from mitchell ( track id 3167 ) on the
16 th . this should be - 0 - also . by taking the conf / allocation for adonis
( track id 6155 ) and mitchell ( track id 3167 ) to zero on the 16 th , the meter

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !

is this date really june of 1999 ? hopefully we ' re not just finding out about
this ?
i don ' t think we can even process this request . the east desk was not up and
running on unify in june of 1999 . all of our pathing for june of 1999 was in
autonoms and it ' s not y 2 k compatabile . with the volumes involved being so
small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question , why don ' t we let
this volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa ? ? ?
i welcome your thoughts .

this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket

stacy ,
could we add the following phrase ( as shown below in red ) to the exxon katy location ? this is to reassure our customers that the delivery is in fact intrastate . please let me know if this is possible to do and if we have your approval .
exxonkaty
the transaction is for delivery of intrastate gas at the tailgate of the exxon katy plant . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general terms and conditions , if applicable , this transaction is between counterparty and enron north america corp .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

hi daren ,
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

if the plants become an external counterparty , the fee should probably go
back to the
scale in the original contract . the assumption being that the original plant
financing could afford
the escalating fee .
let me know if you want me to look into it any further .
thanks

darren ,
how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .

daren ,
i contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday .
however , i know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to
you ) .
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need ,
and for putting up with the "" outlaws "" . in addition to our friendship , i
love you as my own son . again , happy birthday .

hi ,
i figured something must be occupying your time other than answering
non - business e - mail .
you guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each . - - - -
right ? ( chuckle ) .
if tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have
the time ; lunch would be great . just give me a call . only if all the ifs
really allow you the time .
is craig ok ? ? i hope .
i would be glad to help with your sprinkler system . my sharpshooter is older
than you are , but i imagine it is built a little better . my requested wages
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you . i
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer . that would be
free of charge .
i ' m having a cable modem installed monday . supposed to be 50 - 70 times faster
than what i have . i do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem .
i can then dump my other phone line . actually will end up spending less for
more speed . i love technology .
thanks for the info on the stock option . that is the closing price as of
1 / 18 / 00 , which is right before the jump . very nice of management . i like to
know the number to see what might be affecting the price .
well good luck on the extra job and give our best to tonya - - - - not much
longer to go . . . . . . . . . . .

because i ' m a man , when i lock my keys in the car i will
fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your
suggestions that we call a road service until long after
hypothermia has set in .
because i ' m a man , when the car isn ' t running very well ,
i will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if i know what
i ' m looking at . if another man shows up , one of us will say
to the other , "" i used to be able to fix these things , but now
with all these computers and everything , i wouldn ' t know
where to start . ""
because i ' m a man , when i catch a cold i need someone to
bring me soup and take care of me while i lie in bed and moan .
you never get as sick as i do , so for you this isn ' t an issue .
because i ' m a man , i can be relied upon to purchase basic
groceries at the store , like milk or bread . i cannot be expected
to find exotic items like "" cumin "" or "" tofu "" or "" cardamom . ""
for all i know these are all the same thing .
because i ' m a man , when one of our appliances stops working
i will insist on taking it apart , despite evidence that this will just
cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and
has to put it back together .
because i ' m a man , i must hold the television remote control
in my hand while i watch tv . if the thing has been misplaced ,
i may miss a whole show looking for it ( though one time i was
able to survive by holding a calculator ) .
because i ' m a man , i don ' t think we ' re all that lost , and no , i
don ' t think we should stop and ask someone . why would
you listen to a complete stranger - - i mean , how could he
know where we ' re going ?
because i ' m a man , i do not want to visit your mother ,
or have your mother come visit us , or talk to her when she
calls , or think about her any more than i have to .
whatever you got her for mother ' s day is okay , i don ' t
need to see it . and don ' t forget to pick up something for
my mom , too !
because i ' m a man , you don ' t have to ask me if i liked the
movie . chances are , if you ' re crying at the end of it , i didn ' t .
because i ' m a man , yes , i have to turn up the radio when
bruce springsteen or the doors comes on , and then ,
yes , i have to tell you every single time about how bruce
had his picture on the cover of time and newsweek the
same day , or how jim morrison is buried in paris and
everyone visits his grave . please do not behave as if you
do not find this fascinating .
because i ' m a man , i think what you ' re wearing is fine .
i thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine ,
too . either pair of shoes is fine . with the belt or without it
looks fine . your hair is fine . you look fine .
can we just go now ?

therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 ,
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement .
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .
rita : if this becomes burdensome on your group , please let me know and we
will readdress this issue .

i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something .
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .
just a thought , let me know what you think .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

foleys . she was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do
allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and
traders , although she doesn ' t necessarily want to schedule or trade . she

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to

cheryl ,
the counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are :
city of brazoria
central illinois light company
d & h gas company , inc .
markham gas
merit energy partners
praxair
reliant energy - entex
reliant energy - hl & p
southern union company
texas utilities fuel company ( now txu fuel co )
union carbide corporation
unit gas transmission company inc
ena has transacted with the other companies listed below , but that will most
likely not happen again . ( hpl will trade with those counterparties . )
all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara . we have reports which can be
generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena . let me
know if you need something like that .
let me know if you have any other questions .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .",0

you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the

subject : entex transistion
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
"" account "" team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .

there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

2648,ham,"Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in

introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",0

please respond to hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .

553,ham,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

per discussions that hopefully most of you have or will have with your

various issues associated with reconciling and clearing 1999 ua 4 . the scope
of the team will be to work as a team , on production months where the ua 4
number per our accounting systems is considerably larger in comparison to
what the pipeline balancing reports has as unaccounted for . this team will
be dedicated fully to this effort and will need to be prepared to contribute
whatever hours are needed to get the desired results . yvette will be
locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week . this
room will be a "" war room "" . everyone is expected to report to the "" war room ""
on a daily basis and should expect to be there unless something extremely
pressing causes you to have to leave or people need to go back to their
offices to retrieve data or information . the expectations are that this
group will work to identify any volume discrepancies , adjustments , etc . and
be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no
later than mar . 24 , 2000 . this team is effective as of tomorrow , mar . 16 ,
2000 at 9 : 00 a . m .
yvette - please try to locate a room by then and notify the above team members
of the location . in the case that you are not able to find a room right
away , please have everyone go to brenda ' s office in eb 3748 at 9 : 00 a . m .
the items on the radar screen to address in resolving volume issues are :
1 . king ranch

daren ,
we are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the
system . it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller
number than what we have in unify . also , we have not been able to get a
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements
that we do have are not returning phone calls . i also need to know what was
the beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska ? anything else that
we need from you , i will call you .
thanks ,

i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening ,
for use on monday morning .
changes
1 ) "" inactivate suspended children "" - new menu item available by
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the
highlighted parent from "" suspended "" to "" inactive "" . note that this will be
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect .
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia
and singapore ) .
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even
if transactions occur .
background
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are
in an inactive state .

this is the david ' s answer :
the only one that i can think of that may be of use is the "" ces volume
comparison "" report . . . that is the one that ya ' ll had for january that showed
all of the purchases and sales , by pipeline . it is available for any month .
the reports that i regularly used were for helping to clean up current month
activity , which would not be of any use to you .

last month richard burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are
available from ces ' s systems . it is working on a way to secure an electronic
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the
electronic document management system . while ena is not liable for pre - 2000
business , we may need to assist with research as issues arise . in order to
get the ball rolling , we need to get a list together of the reports we need .
please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need
and return it to me by friday , 1 / 15 / 2000 . if you do not want any reports ,
please send me an email letting me know that . i have included samples of how
to fill this out , and if you have any questions please give me a call .
if you aren ' t sure which reports you need based on the names , please get with
any ces employees you have hired or with a ces transition employee to get
clarification . if you need samples of any of these reports please let my
assistant , pam chambers , know and she will coordinate getting a sample report
printed for you .
in addition , i will need a list of the users and their logonid ' s who will
need to have access to this data . please send that to me by the 15 th as
well .
thanks , bryce

clay ,
i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .
thanks , richard

first of the month industrials are coming along fine . i will finalize my
pathing tomorrow , thursday , and set up buybacks and swings by the
end of day friday .
the industrial "" buyback & deficiency deals "" worksheet has captured the
necessary data to help gas control & the on - call scheduler as well as
myself and client services .
i will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day friday .

when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july ? i am a little
concerned with the long weekend coming up . i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .
( six days of flow . ) i definitely don ' t think that we should any later . it
would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
additionally , we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again . this report is very beneficial to gas control , industrial traders and
schedulers on call .
let me know what you think .

daren - -
i know you ' re busy with bid week , so here are a couple questions & comments
for you :
september
i need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
of the williams & apache gas . we still only the supply is in mops . if it
just needs points added to it , just let me know the deal ticket # .
august 31 st
this was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
lonestar 1023 & 1460 . currently , they do not have the supply points needed
for the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
imbalance . . . so i will get them added so this gas can be pathed .
july 31 - aug 7
these days were pathed as buy / sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
ventures .
i worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment ( july &
aug business ) , and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st .
please let me know what you think when you get a chance .

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken

howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .

the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

i received a call from carl drachenberg with hms at approximately 1 : 45 pm on
6 / 13 / 00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter # 986315 and it was wet and
flowing at 35 lb . i asked gary hanks what we want to do and he said to have
carl notify the producer and shut it in . i notified carl and he got in
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx . 2 pm on
6 / 13 and at that time there wasn ' t any flow . carl came back out there at 8
am on 6 / 14 and closed the valve and removed the chart . there was no flow
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf .
the meter is now out of service .

rick ,
just following up my voicemail to you yesterday - - - john griffith has
contacted me regarding the gas management agreement relating to the
cornhusker transaction . when dan was in my office several weeks ago , we spoke
with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas
management agreement were yet to be worked out - - has that occurred yet ? do you
know the details of the extension on the transition agreement ? are you
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you
think should be included ? ( john griffith has asked to be included and
suggests darren farmer and bob hall be present as well ) - - please let me know
thank you ,

pretty quiet here all things considered .

drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time . or if you are

sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

guys ,
just thought you might find this interesting . ? i was forwarded this
poem , and told it was written by a high school student in az .
regardless , of who / where ( not the point ) i find it interesting , weirdly
amusing , and frighteningly fairly accurate . - pb
now i sit me down in school
where praying is against the rule
for this great nation under god
finds mention of him very odd .
if scripture now the class recites ,
it violates the bill of rights .
and anytime my head i bow
becomes a federal matter now .
our hair can be purple , orange or green ,
that ' s no offense , it ' s a freedom scene .
the law is specific , the law is precise .
prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice .
for praying in a public hall
might offend someone with no faith at all .
in silence alone we must meditate ,
god ' s name is prohibited by the state .
we ' re allowed to cuss and dress like freaks ,
and pierce our noses , tongues and cheeks .
they ' ve outlawed guns , but first the bible .
to quote the good book makes me liable .
we can elect a pregnant senior queen ,
and the ' unwed daddy , ' our senior king .
it ' s "" inappropriate "" to teach right from wrong ,
we ' re taught that such "" judgments "" do not belong .
we can get our condoms and birth controls ,
study witchcraft , vampires and totem poles .
but the ten commandments are not allowed ,
no word of god must reach this crowd .
it ' s scary here i must confess ,
when chaos reigns the school ' s a mess .
so , lord , this silent plea i make ,
should i be shot ; my soul please take !

we have some problems with the following two counterparties : txu gas distribution & enbridge consumers gas . for txu gas distribution , this is a unconsolidated division of txu gas company and all deals booked under txu gas distribution should be confirmed as txu gas company . i understand this is not the case . for enbridge consumers gas , this is not a valid entity . at some point it will be a correct name , but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under consumers gas co . ltd .
each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above : sitara 1085609 for txu and 1086002 for enbridge consumers gas .
please advise if there is something i need to do from my end to get this issue resolved .
thanks ,
max sonnonstine

subject : update on prc process
today was the final ena prc . relative ranking results up through the senior
director level are final . you and your management team can begin the process
of giving performance reviews to your employees . i spoke with sheila walton
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting
the employee reviews . she indicated that the target completion date should
be the end of july .
promotions will be effective august lst . it is dave delainey ' s intent to
announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 24 .
this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews . i do not
yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single
memo , or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo . i will keep you
updated on this as i get direction from him .
please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june . in
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid - year review
process , we will not share performance clusters with employees when
conducting their reviews . it is very important for all of us to be
consistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups
who will be giving performance reviews . it is important to note , however ,
that the content of an employee ' s review should be consistent with our view
of that employee ' s relative ranking . in other words , an employee in the
satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that
the employee is doing a great job . clearly , a large number of employees
performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory
category , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in
the organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .
also please note the following :
performance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory , needs improvement or
issues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given
to the employees . this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with
the relative performance of that employee . ( this has been the stated process
for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process
as well . )
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,
yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced
members of your management team , or those management team members where you
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and
perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time
in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow
through on this commitment .
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a
meaningful one .

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

i cannot for the life of me remember why this sale deal is in there . i do
believe it is valid and is a part of the purchase deal with tesoro . jill
zively was the dealmaker and could probably answer your question as could
george weissman and melissa graves . you might also check with anita , the
allocator , to see the support she gets for the allocation . this may give you
some clue as to what this volume represents . ( let me know , too , since i hate

a . bryce baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify ces reports
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that
will be accessed via the electronic document management system .
b . jeff peoples will be working with bryce baxter to produce reports using
ces system via isdn line at enron building - this will continue to be part of
his duty until the job is done ( jeff joined ena as a member of sitara group ) .
c . larry daze will be working with jeff peoples and bryce baxter to ensure
all reports are loaded on our edms with proper indexing .
d . no need for manupulating ces history data is necessary ( i . e . downloading
on spreadsheets ) . therefore , no data will be kept on the disk other than

could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "" just do it ""
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bob",0

daren ,
just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .
let me know

it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .

donald ,
back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .

in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence

cindy , gmt has advised brian that they have not yet received payment for
production at meter 098 - 9814 for the period from 1 / 14 / 2000 to 1 / 31 / 2000 .
would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible ? it
appears that the january deal was 156292 and i believe gmt produced 15 , 984
mmbtu in january .

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont . go for it .
as a precaution , we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious .
once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt
and limit him to this one well . otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
them all through this new meter .",0

1970,ham,"Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )
fred or anita ,
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121
is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the
gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !",0

it has been brought to my attention that sap will not use the buyer as the

currently , sitara captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the

the change were aware of how sitara would reflected the volumes associated

i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",0

i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .

as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .

we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an

big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions .",0

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not

we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .
- if you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel

3329,ham,"Subject: re : gas nom ' s
we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach :
remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request .
the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized "" at or above "" on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) .
after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas .
if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely .
as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations .
hope this helps to clarify where we are .

i just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas
nominations and usage issue . today with this most recent daily nomination
revision from brazos , brazos ( waco ) now understands that we are going to hold
them to 45 , 000 mbtu ' s when they are requesting electrical generation and gas
energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from
brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to
48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy .
to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to
be something less than 258 mw loading per hour .

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm

global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to

if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do

car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also
be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa
variances
on storage .
on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal
type which will be a required field .
someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be
a required field - physical facility or synthetic .
( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be
converted - as well as results for global conversion )
global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so
sitara will add the flag on the deal .
the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to
unify .
once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the
appropriate flag to their system .
once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the
information from global contracts , and we will then
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system .
in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical

daren :
thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter , i appreciate it .
there is a slight problem however , i couldn ' t find the deals for july and
november 1999 in path manager . i looked in sitara and i see where you put
the deal 269123 in for may 1999 , but it is also in for july and november of
2000 . did you mean to put the deal in for july and november of 1999 and
inadvertently put it in for july and november 2000 ? if so would you put it
in for july and november 1999 and send me an e - mail when you are done .
thanks ,

this meter is still an issue .
meter 5192 . i never heard back from aimee on which transport contract to
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still
allocated to the strangers gas contract . aimee is out on vacation until
mid - june so i put in a call to daren farmer to find out which transport
contract i should attach the deal 269123 to .
when i find out which transport contract to use i will set up the accounting
arrangements and then get robert lloyd to put the contract in pops and

please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with

done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the

where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .

the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

752,ham,"Subject: ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .",0

utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

gary , mainline valves to be closed on the 18 "" 3026 line are as follows :
u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back
in service on 4 / 16 / 00 .

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

customer "" force majeure "" letter or should it only be communicated
via notes mail .
there are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial
to other departments , do you have a preference ?

deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20 . the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround .
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown .
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer .

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk
scheduler responsible for the cilco account . the biggest variance is in
january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .

our dbas would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in
contract _ event _ status . we have over 1 gig of data in that table . i would
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any
row with a last _ mod _ date over a month ( or two ) old . so if someone balances
february 1999 this month , we will keep it around for a month ( or two ) .
does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter / longer period
of time ?
this is not an audit table . this is just a "" log "" every nom / track / balance / edi

i have spoken with clem , this meter is now "" non - allocatable "" , not unlike
meter 8751 on big cowboy . this meter needs to be set up as a receipt meter
attached to the gulf energy 27 - 009 - 08 agreement . this gas began flowing on
7 / 7 / 00 , so deal ticket 380710 , which begins 9 / 1 / 00 will need to be backed up
to july to account for the purchase of this production .
bob : please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that i can have
fred set up accounting arrangements on gulf energy .
fred : can you please determine whether or not we have paid ccgm for this gas ?

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we
be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling ,
transport rates and risk are affected .

darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to

it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

subject : teco ' s indian spring plant
a meeting was held on november 1 , 2000 at 3 pm in eb 3270 to resolve exxon ' s
residue volume issue at teco ' s indian spring plant . exxon ' s issue is that
the residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon ' s account for
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to
pge .
items that were identified so that exxon ' s issue could be resolved :
1 . hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss / gain and fuel consumed on pge ' s line
attributable to exxon ' s big sandy production .
2 . if exxon ' s production exceeds 500 mcf / d , hpl must on a monthly basis
elect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas . if hpl elects
to process , then teco buys the products from hpl .
3 . if exxon ' s production flows between 100 mcf / d and 499 mcf / d , then teco
can process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes .
4 . if exxon ' s production is less than 100 mcf / d , then hpl must terminate
the processing agreement . if hpl does not terminate and volume continue
to flow at less that 100 mcf / d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must
pay to teco an additional $ 500 per month .
solution :
1 . hpl will schedule and record the gain / loss volumes at hpl meter # 986884
that is attributable to ua 4 and fuel on the pge line .
2 . hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl
meter # 986884 .
3 . the scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset
volumes to be record as adjustments to exxon ' s transport volumes .
4 . the hpl logistics dept . ( mary poorman ) will inform assets group ( jack
simunek ) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf / d .
if any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to , please
let me know at x - 36650 .

there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .",0

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it

email : duvmalo @ mailasia . com
attn : dear president / md .
with due respect , trust and humility , i use this
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do not know me , but please do consider this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance .
let me formally introduce myself . i am duve khumalo , the son of late . dr . robinson khumalo , the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer .
i got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual / company who can assist me in this business .
during the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group , because he did not support their ideas and policies .
in the course of the revolution in the country , the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father ' s farms burning , destroying and eventually killing him . after my father ' s death last year , i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother , because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us .
we escaped safely into south africa with my father ' s lifetime fortune of us $ 25 ( twenty five million
us dollars ) cash , bonds , important documents of property title and other valuables , which he instructed i his son on before his death . the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes , and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means .
the boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands .
presently , i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum .
at the moment , i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments . moreover , due to netherlands government ' s stringent monetary policies / regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region , it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances .
in recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country , i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments .
my mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money .
we have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund .
i have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us .
please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address ( khumaduvel 01 @ netscape . net ) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly , send your phone and fax number for easier communication .
if you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that i can look for a suitable alternative .
please accept my warm compliments , as i earnestly wait for your urgent response .
best regard ,
duve khumalo

kowloon , hong kong .
reply destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
i am mr . srichai pope , credit officer of win hang bank ltd . i have an urgent and
very
confidential business proposition for you .
on august 6 , 1999 , a british consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals
corporation , mr . philip brian a british citizen made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit
for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty - eight million
dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent aroutine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply .
after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers , the hong kong solid minerals corporation that mr . philip brian died from
a boat mishap . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a
will , and all attempts totrace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made
further investigation and discovered that mr . philip brian did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my
bank . this sum of us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever
come forward to claim it . according to laws of hong kong , at the expiration of 5
( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the hong kong
government if nobody applies to claim the fund .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the
next of kin to mr . philip brian so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to
provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin .
the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65 % for me
and 30 % for you and 5 % for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction .
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction .
if you are interested , please reply immediately to my e - mail
box . destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication . you should
observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply .
sincerely
mr . srichai pope .

dear friend ,
permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
business relationship with you .
i am mr andy monga , the only son of late mr and mrs
banabas monga . my father was a very wealthy cocoa
merchant in abidjan , the economic capital of ivory
coast , my father was poisoned to death by his business
associates in one of their outings on a business trip .
my mother died when i was a baby and since then , my
father took me so special . before the death of my
father on january 2002 in a private hospital here in
abidjan , he secretly called me on his bedside and told
me that he has the sum of eighteen million , five
hundred
thousand us dollars ( us $ 18 , 500 , 000 ) left in a fixed /
suspense account in one of the prime banks here in
abidjan , that he used my name as his only son for the
next of kin in depositing the fund . he also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth
that he was poisoned by his business associates . that
i should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where i will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose such as real estate management or
hotel management .
i am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways :
1 ) to serve as a guardian of this fund since i am only
20 years old
2 ) to make arrangement for me to come over to your
country to further my education and to secure a
resident permit for me in your country .
moreover , i am willing to offer you 15 % of the
total sum as compensation for your effort / input after
the successful transfer of this fund into your
nominated account overseas and 5 % for expenses .
furthermore , you indicate your options towards
assisting me as i believe that this transaction would
be concluded within ( 24 ) days you signify
interest to assist me .
anticipating to hear from you soon .
thanks and god bless !

dear friend ,
i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe .
this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the
interest of the country .
it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum .
i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you .
all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets .
there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country .
we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers .
i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction .
i shall furnish you with more details on request .
yours truly
mr . williems tomu

where were you when the following stocks exploded :
scos : exploded from . 39 on september 1 to 1 . 41 close on october 14 .
sior : september lst close of . 24 . blew through the roof as it
passed . 80 on friday .
face it . little stocks can mean big gains for you . this report is
part of a large pr campaign on this stock .
about the company :
the primary objective of hpng is to participate in specialty finance
within the public and private markets . hampden has partnerships
with finance and in surance companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short - term financing .
hampden is a unique finance company that uses new technologies to
help track and protect loan portfolio assets . the use of
sophisticated tracking technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and allows the company to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments . in addition to physical
asset backed lending , hampden grp . will also actively participate
in structured financial contracts with small public companies
through pipe ( private investment public entity ) transactions .
hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short - term working capital and cannot obtain
traditional financing .
hampden ' s business plan provides collateralized financing to
its customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25 % . the
company ' s valuation , financial ratios , executive compensation , exit
strategy , and other management decisions are driven directly from
the business plan . ( source : news announcement 10 / 15 / 04 )
will hpng explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until it is too
late . remember , timing your trade is critical . good luck and happy
trading .

from : mrs . ruth makary .
please endeavour to use this for charity .
calvary greetings ! !
my name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a
nationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with
kuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile
crash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .
before his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive
we protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life
insurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance
company . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the
purpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of
accrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund
and the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but
unfortunately he dies .
recently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer
problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this
sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the
breaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved
in an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december
1999 .
having known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate
this fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a
christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to
instruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,
orphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to
ensure that the house of god is maintained .
i took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit
this money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are
not christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in
an ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .
i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is
entitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .
exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my
peace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .
with god all things are possible .
i have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive
your reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the
contacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the
freezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process
the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you
to take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a
reality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i
pray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .
i want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i
lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord
must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through
your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other
people for this same purpose .
please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in
anyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always
remember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you .
remain blessed in the name of the lord .
yours in christ ,
mrs . ruth makary .

5055,spam,"Subject: cheap soft cialis tabs
these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .
before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .
it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .
i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .
thank for your anticipated co - operations .

now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search
yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review
of the two systems .
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,
both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca
adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .
the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in
sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel
quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .
after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have
said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and
are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its
oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm
has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored
comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find
totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular
( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s
no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you
buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying
in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up
loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .
this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my
cancelling xm .
xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept
xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no
matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered
everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the
talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the
useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius
also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .
however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all
have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for
the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .",1

investor financial times report
specializing in undervalued small cap stocks for immediate breakout
erhc and exxon mobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after oil
blocks in nigeria and sao tome ' s joint development zone ( jdz ) in the
gulf of guinea .
every major news wire service worldwide has carried hundreds of articles
revealing that the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15
billion barrels of oil . the jdz line - up tipped to take over upcoming
blocks includes exxon mobil , erhc , chevron texaco , amerada hess ,
and anadarko .
license approval for the region ' s exclusive economic zone ( eez ) is a
multilateral deal securing blocks jointly involving exxon mobil , erhc ,
and chevron texaco .
erhc has jumped from a . 25 cent stock earlier in the year to a . 50 cent
stock that is headed for over $ 2 or a possible buyout from one of their
jdz multinational players .
erhc has been at the negotiating tables with the super - major oil
companies . it is impossible to measure the power that is carried where a
stock at this price level is a vital part of a key union of oil giants !
the top - level executives of the jdz oil majors have been finalizing the
percentage awards with erhc for official announcement of the
landmark - licensing round in the first 2 weeks of june .
the us government is pushing for increasing development of the area to
minimize middle east dependence . the eyes of the world are watching with
record prices at the pump and oil busting through $ 40 per barrel .
the oil companies will always make their $ billions - investors can cash
in by accumulating a substantial position just before earth - shattering
news is released that will send shock waves through erhc .

nomad international inc . ( ndin )
a multi - national internet communications company developing cost
effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip )
technologies .
shares outstanding : 34 , oo 0 , ooo
float : 4 , 00 o , ooo
current price : o . 08
will it continue higher ? watch this one monday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which
includes bermuda .
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s
market as soon as practicably possible .
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive
to the caribbean market .
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
about nomad international inc .
nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications
company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,
cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on
targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,
2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european

their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more
economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their

companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil beit
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas
providing opportunity
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large
recoverabie reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled
by major oil companies
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia | recoverable
reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the
two pay zones .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 065
the value of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably sma | | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but a | | that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive
effect on the share price .
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or
deciine
slightiy , you will stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wil | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive
production .
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this
area wil | reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bu | | etin .

attn ; dear sir / madam .
i am mr . michael fisher , in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance department of barclay ' s bank .
i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co - operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department . we discovered an unclaimed sum of  24 . 5 million ( twenty - four million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account belonging to one of our customer , who died in a car crash with the entire family in year 2001 .
since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money . unfortunately , neither the family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money . we cannot release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or relation to the deceased .
our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed for a period of four ( 4 ) years , it would be transferred into barclay ' s bank treasury as unclaimed fund . another officer and i in the department now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this money to go back into the bank treasury as the unclaimed debt . in fact it is my friend that advised me to urgently arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary outside the country .
we have decided to give you 20 % of the total sum . so please , as a matter of urgency send to me your telephone and fax numbers for effective communication . i will do my best to see that we conclude this transaction successfully on time .
please if you are interested send me an immediate mail so that i can explain the details to you , so you could understand everything about this business waiting for your urgent response .
thank you .

dear friend ,
i am mr . richard mayer , the accountant general of nedbank of south
africa . i request your co - operation in the transfer of money amounting to
u . s . d . 32 million .
on september 2001 , an american pilot , mr . roy kenob , an american ational
made a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on
maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno
reply . after a month , i sent a reminder and finally his employers
wrote to inform us that mr . kenob died in a plane crash , that he died without
making a will while our attempt to trace his next of kin through american
embassy proved fruitless .
when he was making deposition in my bank , he did not declare his next of
kin in his deposit application form , when i reminded him he said he
wished it so , in the conservative manner of our bank , i did not turn down
his request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is
that his employer are not aware of his deposit with us , therefore i am the
only person who know about mr . roy ' s deposit of u . s . d 32 , 000 , 000 . 00 which
is now lying in dormant account portfolio , the whole account relating to
mr . kenob ' s deposit is also with me .
i am looking forward for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of
kin to mr . roy . i have worked out modalities of achieving my aim by
appointing you as the next of kin to mr . roy as well as transfer the u . s . d
32 , 000 , 000 . 00 abroad for us to share . i will use an attorney who will represent
you as the beneficiary to execute series a written will and attestament
of late mr . roy kenob , in support of your claim including certificate of
origin of the money , letter of probate which empowers you as the sole trustee / executor
to the estate of mr . roy kenob . please note that you will not be required
to sign any transfer document , as the appointed attorney will do all
that .
if you agree to act as the next of kin / beneficiary to enable me
transfer / convert the money to our own benefit / use . i will give you 30 % of
usd 32 m , 60 % will be for me while 10 % will be to take care of all unforeseen
expenses as we may incure in the course of concluding this transaction .
i am urgently waiting for your positive reply on the address below .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !

hi there
hope you don ' t mind me contacting you , but i thought you may be interested
in
this , as like me , you are obviously serious about making some money . . .
i have heard nothing but great things about this . so give it a shot .
 5 . . . that ' s all it takes . . .
i ' ll keep it short and sweet .
to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it
in an
e - mail to edit it .
once i got started the money started rolling in ! ! ! just like the plan below
said it would !
i am currently getting over  200 a day and just started
weekago ! ! ! ! !
believe it or not , this is my 2 nd time around . simply follow the
instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks , you will have at least  20 , 000 in
your
paypal account .
most people respond to this program because of the low investment (  5 ) and
high profit potential . the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 % . there is no
limit
to the income you can generate from this business ( you can do it over and
over ) . this program is the fastest , easiest program you will ever do .
the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place .
if
they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to , and
only
make a few pounds .
if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people ! honesty ,
faith and integrity make this system work .
team work makes the dream work ! lets get started !
i think everyone has heard of "" paypal "" ( if not you will ) . paypal ( owned by
ebay ) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online . anyone
with
an email address can join for free ! if you ' re not already a paypal user , the
first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free :
use the link above to sign up for a free account , then send a  5 . 00 donation
from
your paypal account ( you will earn back  5 . 00 from paypal , for signing up
anyway ! ) to only the first email address on the list along with a note
saying : "" please add me to your mailing list "" .
now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying "" thanks i ' ve joined "" .
then , remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom .
this
should move the second place into the first place and the third place into
second and fourth into the third .
don ' t try to place yourself in the first place .
it will only reach the people you send it to , and then your name will be
removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system
work .
if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time
your name gets to the top . remember to only send a  5 . 00 donation to the
first
e - mail address , and send "" thanks i ' ve joined "" to the fourth person . this
lets the
4 th person keep track of their progress .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1 . siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail . com
2 . jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail . com
3 . @ hotmail . com
4 . nic @ madstock . freeserve . co . uk
now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth
person a note , place your email address in the fourth place ( make sure its
the
same email address you used for your paypal account ) this is the way you
will
receive payment .
ok , the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more ( ! ) of
this
letter in a week or so . when your name reaches the top of the list it will
be
your turn to collect your money from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people just like
yourself
who are willing to spend  5 . 00 and half an hour of there time to receive
 20 , 000
in cash ! keep in mind . . . the most you ' ve spent is  5 .
testimonials : d . rayner london : i only have one thing to say to
you . . . . oh my god ! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on
holiday . when i got back my account had over  12 , 000 in it already ! i ' m
still
floating on air ( especially with my new car i bought ! ) !
thanks !
this programe works , it really does .
so good luck to the rest of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",1

recent price $ 0 . 71
tirr is up over 70 % in the past two weeks ! ! !
tradestar corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have profited nicely .
the company
tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america . new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas @ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again ! using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! ! with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign , experienced management team , and application of cutting edge ep technologies , we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company ! ! ! !
previous news

hot springs , ark . , - - tradestar ( otc : tirr ) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture agreement with united production and exploration of houston , texas to reenter and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county , texas . in addition to the gas well reentry , the prospect , which covers 111 acres , has an additional location to drill a new well . the objective formation of the recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of approximately 4 , 830 ' to 5 , 030 ' with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone . estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750 , 000 mcf for each well .
why we love this stock
1 . continued rise in world oil gas prices !
2 . over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas
3 . strong industry investment banking relationships
4 . strong management - over 50 years of experience in the oil patch
5 . multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners

7 . business model offers only real solution to u . s . dependency on foreign oil .
8 . the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est . reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas !
conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm . the company ' s resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more information on tirr , go to tradestar - corp . com for sec filings or press releases .

oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers

eogi is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production
revenue and becoming a cash - fiow positive leader in major oil - producing
states .
eogi ' s high - yieiding , muitiple driiling programs have been solidified
through valuabie strategic a | | iances . these expioration partnerships
enable the company to accumuiate substantia | working interests being
deveioped into a continuously expanding revenue stream . eogi is focused on
joint - ventures invoiving well re - entry programs in extremely prolific
production areas using the highest | evel of technology currently
avaiiabie .
recent deveiopments for eogi have been perfectiy timed as al | 6 dow

energy stocks outperforming all other market sectors . the company ' s oi |
and gas interests in louisiana and texas , in addition to their

value with energy prices up 60 % from one year ago . leading economists

likeiy next year .
we are expecting eogi to reiease major news announcements regarding
production figures on muitipie projects in high - gear . eogi ' s expansion
plans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can
oniy add to their growing bottom - line and spark further interest in
this undervaiued oil play . with a very smal | float estimated at less than

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,
sincerely ,
